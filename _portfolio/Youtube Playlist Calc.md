## Browser Extension/ Add-On

Find out the total duration or length of the YouTube Playlist (lectures, tutorials, music, video clips) and see how much you have watched (also displayed as a progress bar).

Keep track of the lectures, musics videos, movie clips of playlists you are watching.

Works perfectly with huge playlists as well. Hit refresh button when the instruction tells you.

Once the time has loaded, there is no need to refresh. Just click on the icon to see the time and progress.

When more than 100 videos are in the playlist, scroll down and load more videos to find out full length of the playlist.
