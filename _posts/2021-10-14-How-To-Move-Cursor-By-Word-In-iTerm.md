###### I do like the default terminal on MacOS!

##### but my colleague introduced iTerm to me and I have been enjoying it since then :)

##### If you are a terminal person, this trick might save you some time!

##### Let's learn how to move cursor by word or to move far to the start/end of the command in terminal.

##### First, open the terminal(iTerm)

##### Go to 'preference'

##### Now follow these steps!

(1) click `Profiles`

(2) click `Keys`

##### Make sure to go to 'Profiles' first, not Keys right next to it!!

(3) click `Key Mappings`

(4) click `Presets...`

(4) select `Natural Text Editing`
